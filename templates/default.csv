# ========================================
# == HOW TO USE BATCH FILES FOR REAMAKE ==
# ========================================

# == PROJECT BLOCKS ==

# In the example up top you see three project blocks.
# It's important that each project "block" is 6 lines long (uninterrupted!)
# with two fields on each line.
# But the amount of blank lines in between each block doesn't matter.

# == OPTION FIELDS ==

# Every option field is optional and has fallbacks,
# except for the destination path which is required.
# If there's a parameter you don't feel like specifying,
# still be sure to keep that field filled with something
# since the reamake batch parser might otherwise get confused!
# Don't worry - reamake will replace any dummy string
# you input here with a fallback. :)

# == COMMENTS ==

# You can create comments using hashtags.
# Useful for making notes or to-do lists in your batch files!
# Note that the reamake batch parser will consider any line with a hashtag in it a comment,
# so don't place a comment on the same line as an option field to avoid errors.

# == COMMANDS ==

# When your batch file is ready,
# paste its absolute path into the terminal as an argument to 'remake batch'.
# Example: reamake batch '/Users/simondanielsson/Desktop/music/templates/batchfile.csv'
